Dogs
====
When I was a kid, I liked dogs.


Jin Wang: add something, But now I don't have such feelings for dogs.

Some kinds of dogs are still lovely to me,esp. those who have a life-long commitment to their owners.

However, cats seem to be more quiet and more independent. 

How can you say so much about cats and not love dogs. Dogs are far far better!
